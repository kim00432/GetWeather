### Hightlights
* Use Open Weather Map, LocationIQ and Google Places API services
* Mobile first, responsive and accessible web application
* Allow the user to switch between an hourly forecast for the next 6 hours or a daily forecast for the next 6 days
* Have an option to allow the browser to access user's current location
* Store the most recent location and forecast data in localStorage. Display this data by default when the user first opens (or refreshes) the page (Default location: "Nepean")
